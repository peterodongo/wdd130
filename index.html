        <p>Hello, my name is Peter Odongo and i come from Kenya. currently i am 22 years old. i
            have two siblings all being sisters. so far i am enrolled at BYU pathway studing soft
            ware engineer. it has been my dream and getting into it just makes it possible for it to
            come true later in the future. growing up as a kid in Kenya has made me see or have
            experince on both side, which is good because from this, i have grown. even stronger and
            learned the importance of enduring to the end </p>
